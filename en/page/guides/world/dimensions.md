To understand better the process of creating new dimensions with custom generation, let's look through a couple of examples. To simplify the task of creating dimension generator, take a look at [Inner Core Dimension Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/zheka2304/present/kJmbShOU2).

## Creating a Custom Dimension

```js
var dimension = new Dimensions.CustomDimension('CustomDimension', 33);
// Some additional dimension setup,
// e.g. setting some of the environment colors:
dimension.setSunsetColor(0.2, 1, 0.7);
```

Here we just create a new dimension. To teleport the player to your dimension, use the [[Dimensions.transfer]] method, e.g.:

```js
Callback.addCallback('ItemUse', function (coords, item) {
    // If player uses a stick
    if (item.id == 280) {
        Dimensions.transfer(Player.get(), Player.getDimension() == 0 ? dimension.id : 0);
    }
});
```

## Superflat Generation

```js
var generator = Dimensions.newGenerator({
    layers: [
        {
            minY: 0,
            maxY: 64,
            material: {
                base: 1,
                cover: 2,
                surface: {
                    id: 3,
                    width: 5,
                },
            },
        },
    ],
});
dimension.setGenerator(generator);
```

In this minimalistic example we are creating a single generation layer between y = 0 and y = 64, using stone as the base material. We also use grass and dirt to build the upper part of the generation. Since we are not creating any noise explicitly, a default solid noise octave is created. To specify some of the properties of the octave, we should either explicitly create one in the `octaves` property or just specify the required properties in our layer's description object.

## Single Layer Generation

![Generation Example #1](../../../assets/images/pages/dimensions-1.jpg)

```js
var generator = Dimensions.newGenerator({
    layers: [
        {
            minY: 0,
            maxY: 128,
            yConversion: [
                [0, 0.5],
                [1, -0.5],
            ],
            material: { base: 1 },
            noise: {
                octaves: { count: 4, scale: 40 },
            },
        },
    ],
});
dimension.setGenerator(generator);
```

In this example we generate a layer between 0 and 128. `octaves` property contains an object that is treated as parameterized description of the octaves to be generated. See [[Dimensions.NoiseLayerParams]] for parameter details and default values. Every noise octave is generated using the following formulas:

```js
// Pre-calculated parameter
var mul = (2 * ((1 << count) - 1)) / (1 << count);
var seed = 0;

// For every of the count octaves
var octave = {
    scale: { x: 1 / scale.x, y: 1 / scale.y, z: 1 / scale.z },
    weight: weight / mul,
    seed,
};
scale.x /= scale_factor.x;
scale.y /= scale_factor.y;
scale.z /= scale_factor.z;
mul *= weight_factor;
```

Thus, the `octaves: {count: 4, scale: 40}` gets transformed into:

```js
octaves: {
    {scale: 0.025, weight: 0.5333, seed: 0},
    {scale: 0.05, weight: 0.2667, seed: 1},
    {scale: 0.1, weight: 0.1333, seed: 2},
    {scale: 0.2, weight: 0.0667, seed: 3}
}
```

`yConversion` is a function that transforms the landscape in the Y direction. Basically, it is the density of landscape at the specified Y position. It is specified as a set of points (x, y), and the values between these points get interpolated. X values generally should be between 0 and 1, and y values between -0.5 and 0.5.

To better understand how this function works, let's take a couple of examples (you can use [Inner Core Dimension Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/zheka2304/present/kJmbShOU2) to visualize results quickly).

```js
yConversion: [
    [0, 0.5],
    [1, -0.5],
];
```

Creates a landscape where most of the blocks are concentrated in the bottom part of the layer:

![Generation Example #2](../../../assets/images/pages/dimensions-2.jpg)

```js
yConversion: [
    [0, 0.5],
    [0.5, -0.5],
    [1, 0.5],
];
```

Creates a landscape where most of the blocks are concentrated in the bottom and the top parts of the layer, leaving the middle empty:

![Generation Example #3](../../../assets/images/pages/dimensions-3.jpg)

```js
yConversion: [
    [0, 0.5],
    [0.25, -0.3],
    [0.5, 0.3],
    [0.75, -0.3],
    [1, 0.5],
];
```

Creates a more complex landscape like the one displayed on the image:

![Generation Example #4](../../../assets/images/pages/dimensions-4.jpg)

## Dimension Materials

![Generation Example #5](../../../assets/images/pages/dimensions-5.jpg)

```js
var generator = Dimensions.newGenerator({
    layers: [
        {
            minY: 0,
            maxY: 128,
            yConversion: [
                [0, 1],
                [0.6, -0.2],
                [1, -1],
            ],
            noise: { octaves: { count: 4, scale: 50, weight: 0.5 } },
            debug: 'none',
            heightmap: {
                octaves: [
                    { type: 'sine_xz', scale: 1 / 15, weight: 0.5 },
                    { scale: 1 / 2, weight: 0.1 },
                    { scale: 1 / 20, weight: 0.5 },
                ],
            },
            material: { base: 1 },
            materials: [
                {
                    base: 3,
                    diffuse: 0.1,
                    noise: {
                        octaves: [
                            { scale: 0.1, weight: 0.6 },
                            { scale: 0.2, weight: 0.3 },
                        ],
                    },
                },
            ],
        },
    ],
});
dimension.setGenerator(generator);
```

In this example there are two noticeable facts: non-perlin octave usage (see [[NoiseOctave.constructor]] for details) and using materials noise.

Non-perlin octaves allow for creating some interesting landscapes, though you should be careful not to generate a poorly mathematical landscape that will repeat itself all the time.

Materials noise can be used for single generation layer to consist of blocks of different types. In our example we use dirt as a second material and generate perlin noise to determine its propagation.

## Multilayer Generation

When you need a more complex generation, you can use multiple layers. Layers are generated in the order they were listed in the description object, so you should want to generate a water layer at first. Let's take a look at some example:

![Generation Example #6](../../../assets/images/pages/dimensions-6.jpg)

```js
var generator = Dimensions.newGenerator({
    layers: [
        {
            minY: 0,
            maxY: 64,
            material: { base: 8 },
        },
        {
            minY: 0,
            maxY: 128,
            yConversion: [
                [0, 1],
                [1, -1],
            ],
            material: { base: 2, cover: 2 },
            noise: {
                octaves: { count: 5, scale: 150 },
            },
        },
        {
            minY: 0,
            maxY: 180,
            yConversion: [
                [0, 0.5],
                [0.6, -0.5],
                [1, -1],
            ],
            material: { base: 1 },
            noise: {
                octaves: { count: 2, scale: 70, seed: 100 },
            },
            heightmap: {
                octaves: { count: 3, scale: 600 },
                conversion: [
                    [0, 0.5],
                    [1, -0.5],
                ],
            },
        },
    ],
});
dimension.setGenerator(generator);
```

In this example we have three layers of generation:

-   Solid water layer at the height of 64
-   Grass layer with cover, a base landscape
-   Stone layer, a mountainous landscape with an additional heightmap

Heightmap is a 2-dimensional (x, z) noise that is used to generate a general height scheme of the layer. In our example it is used to generate mountains only time to time. Note that we use 1 and -1 as values of `yConversion` function of grass layer to make the landscape more flat.

To make mountains less rounded, we can change the count of octaves of the stone layer. Say, we had 6 octaves in the stone layer, the generation should look like this:

![Generation Example #7](../../../assets/images/pages/dimensions-7.jpg)

However, you should always think twice before adding a lot of octaves and layers. Massive generation requires more time for calculations, so it is generally better to use layer conversions and heightmap of the existing layer then create multiple layers with more noise octaves.
