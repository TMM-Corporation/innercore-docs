Abilities is a mechanism that allows to set some flags (allow/disallow actions) or values (fly speed, walk speed) for the player. InnerCore provides an interface to the underlying Abilities implementation. Not all of the abilities are well tested, some may not work at all.

Abilities may be of two types: _boolean_ and _float_. The appropriate setter is invoked automatically when you call [[Player.setAbility]] function. To keep types consistent, two functions, [[Player.getFloatAbility]] and [[Player.getBooleanAbility]] are used to retrieve value in the required form.

You can find the list of all the abilities with their default values available in Minecraft 1.11.4 below. If you find out more information about some of the abilities, feel free to contribute (See {@page Contributing}).
