Inner Core was created on the basis of pure MCBE 1.0.3/1.11.4/1.16.201 and is a full-fledged environment for creating and playing with mods, giving opportunities much greater than CoreEngine & BlockLauncher.

The native part, written from scratch, made it possible to solve the absolute majority of problems associated with modding based on BlockLauncher and make the API much more efficient.
