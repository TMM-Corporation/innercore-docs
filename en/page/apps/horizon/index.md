## What is HMK?

_**HMK** - Horizon Modding Kernel App_

Horizon is a universal platform for launching mobile games with mods. At the moment, it supports only InnerCore, which contains Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.11.4 and 1.16.201. Horizon allows you to create and store several independent InnerCore packages, which in turn allows you to divide different mod packs and worlds with these packages. Development can take place in JavaScript, Java, C++ and not only.

## Structure of the HMK pack

1. The game on which the launcher is based
2. The launcher on which the user will play
3. The browser of mods that the user can apply to the game

## Native mods

Mods are written in c++ and applied to game directly.
They have full access to game and can use all its functions.
